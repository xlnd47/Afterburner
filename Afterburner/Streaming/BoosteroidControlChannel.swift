// MARK: - Boosteroid Control WebSocket
//
// CONFIRMED 2026-07-23 via live testing + reading Boosteroid's own
// `streaming.js`/`catch-events.js`/`webrtcstreamer.js` bundles. This socket
// is the PRIMARY control plane for a streaming session — far more than an
// "input channel":
//
//   1. Opening it CLAIMS THE SESSION FOR THIS DEVICE. Doing so triggers a
//      "switch device" server-side — CONFIRMED by a live test: opening a
//      second control socket (with clientType=native) against a session that
//      was actively streaming in a browser instantly kicked the browser to a
//      "you just switched your session to another device" screen. This is
//      why the tvOS app, before it opened this socket at all, could only ever
//      get video by piggybacking a session a browser had already claimed —
//      and why opening it at the WRONG time (after WebRTC negotiation, as a
//      first buggy pass did) black-screened everything.
//   2. Once open, the server PUSHES session config on it: `settings/udpforward`
//      (raw-UDP transport ports, unused by the WebRTC path), `settings/streamIds`
//      (resolution), and a `stream/*` burst (`bitrate`, `framerate`, `key`).
//   3. It GATES WebRTC: the web client starts its WebRTC engine
//      (`WebRtcTransport.connect()` → getIceServers/call/ICE) ONLY from the
//      handler for a `{"type":"settings","action":"webrtc"}` message pushed
//      on THIS socket. So the correct order is: open this socket FIRST, wait
//      for `settings/webrtc`, THEN do WebRTC signaling. StreamController now
//      follows exactly that order (see its connect()).
//   4. It carries ALL input — keyboard, mouse, and gamepad — as JSON frames,
//      entirely separate from the WebRTC media path (the earlier assumption,
//      carried over from CloudNow/GFN, that input rides a WebRTC data channel
//      was wrong; a live RTCDataChannel capture saw zero input bytes).
//
// CONFIRMED URL construction (`SessionHandler.wssHandler` in streaming.js):
//   wss://{nodeHost}/?{queryString}&x={width}&y={height}&lang={lang}
//     &refreshRate={rate}&rtcEngine=webrtc&clientType={web|native|controller}
//     &devType={desktop|mobile|tv|avtomotive|tablet}&os={win|lin|mac|a|atv|
//     webos|tizen|titan|vidaa|fireos}&rtcAudio=pcm
// - `nodeHost` is the SAME per-session gateway host as WebRTC signaling
//   (SessionInfo.nodeBaseUrl, e.g. "sp7.cloud.boosteroid.com:443").
// - `queryString` is EXACTLY `session/details`'s `data.queryString` JWT —
//   previously fetched and stored on SessionInfo but never used for
//   anything (see SessionInfo's doc comment, now corrected).
// - `clientType` DETERMINES THE VIDEO TRANSPORT — CONFIRMED live 2026-07-23,
//   the decisive finding: `clientType=native` makes the server stream RAW UDP
//   (it sends `settings/udpforward` with ip/videoport/audioport and NEVER
//   `settings/webrtc`), while `clientType=web` makes it send `settings/webrtc`
//   and use WebRTC. Boosteroid's own bundle enumerates "native"/"tv"/"atv", so
//   a native TV client IS anticipated — but as a RAW-UDP client, not a WebRTC
//   one. Since this app streams via WebRTC (livekit), it must declare
//   `clientType=web` to get the transport it actually implements. (An earlier
//   pass used `native` on the theory that "we're a native TV app"; that was the
//   root cause of no video — the server set us up for a UDP stream we never
//   listen for.) Implementing the raw-UDP path instead would be a separate,
//   much larger effort (a UDP RTP receiver keyed by the `stream/key` value).
//
// CONFIRMED message envelope: plain JSON TEXT frames (not binary), shape
// `{type, action, ...fields}`. For the four "external device" types
// (keyboard/mouse/controller/finger — CONFIRMED array literal in
// `SessionHandler.sendEvents`) the web client auto-appends an incrementing
// `id_cmd` and `from_udp: false` before sending; replicated in `send`
// below rather than requiring every call site to remember it.
//
// CONFIRMED per-type shapes (grep the git history / CLAUDE.md for the exact
// source snippets this was read from):
//   keyboard button:   {type:"keyboard", action:"button", isPressed, code}
//     `code` is a Windows Virtual-Key code — confirmed from the web
//     client's own stats-hotkey-release helper, which sends 0xA0-0xA3
//     (VK_LSHIFT..VK_RCONTROL). VideoSurfaceView's existing HID->VK table
//     (built for GFN) already produces exactly these VK values, unchanged.
//   mouse button:  {type:"mouse", action:"button", isPressed, btn}
//     (btn = standard DOM MouseEvent.button: 0 left, 1 middle, 2 right)
//   mouse wheel:   {type:"mouse", action:"wheel", deltaY: ±1}
//   mouse move (relative, pointer captured):
//     {type:"mouse", movementX, movementY, surfaceWidth, surfaceHeight,
//      syncLocalPosition, movementIsAdjusted}
//   mouse move (absolute, desktop/launcher) — CONFIRMED 2026-07-27 by
//     live-capturing real outgoing WebSocket frames (patched
//     WebSocket.prototype.send in a real session and clicked around the Steam
//     desktop), which caught an earlier reading-the-source guess still being
//     wrong:
//     {type:"mouse", action:"move", X, Y, offsetX:0, offsetY:0,
//      isVisible:true}
//     `X`/`Y` are FRACTIONS of the surface (0.0-1.0), NOT pixels, and there is
//     NO surfaceWidth/surfaceHeight on this shape at all — those only belong
//     to the relative-move shape above. An earlier guess sent
//     {type:"mouse", X, Y, surfaceWidth, surfaceHeight} (no `action`, raw
//     pixel X/Y) — the server silently dropped it since it doesn't match
//     either real shape, so the cursor never actually moved server-side even
//     though our own drawn arrow did, and clicks landed nowhere useful.
//   mouse connected (send once before the first move/button):
//     {type:"mouse", action:"connected", LeftBtnState:false,
//      MiddleBtnState:false, RightBtnState:false}
//   controller connected: {type:"controller", action:"connected",
//     name:"<gamepad vendor/product string><index>"} — the SERVER echoes
//     this back with an added `id` field; that `id` must be attached to
//     every subsequent button/axes/pad event for that controller (the web
//     client's `GamepadController.canSendInput` refuses to send without
//     one, so this client waits for the ack too rather than guessing).
//   controller disconnected: {type:"controller", action:"disconnected", id}
//   controller button: {type:"controller", action:"button", id, button,
//     value} — indices CONFIRMED from catch-events.js: 0=A 1=B 2=X 3=Y
//     4=LB 5=RB 6=Back 7=Start 8=LSclick 9=RSclick. LT/RT are NOT sent as
//     buttons — see axes 2/5 below.
//   controller axes: {type:"controller", action:"axes", id, axes, value}
//     — axes CONFIRMED: 0=LeftX 1=LeftY 2=LeftTrigger 3=RightX 4=RightY
//     5=RightTrigger. `value` is a SIGNED 16-bit range (±32767): sticks map
//     [-1,1] directly via round(x * 32767); triggers (naturally [0,1]) are
//     linearly remapped onto the SAME ±32767 range via
//     round(x * 32767 * 2) - 32767, i.e. an unpressed trigger reports
//     -32767, not 0.
//   controller pad (D-pad, sent as a hat rather than 4 buttons):
//     {type:"controller", action:"pad", id, hat} — CONFIRMED 2026-07-24 from
//     catch-events.js: `hat` is a DIRECTION BITMASK (up=1, right=2, down=4,
//     left=8) OR'd for diagonals (up+left=9, up+right=3, down+left=12,
//     down+right=6), and hat=0 is sent on release. NOT a POV-hat rotation
//     number. `id` is a NUMBER on the wire (not a string).
//   controller rumble (SERVER -> client): {type:"controller",
//     action:"rumble", id, left, right} — `left`/`right` are 0...1
//     intensities, matching the browser Gamepad API's dual-rumble effect
//     this mirrors. Forwarded to the real controller via GameController's
//     CoreHaptics bridge — see InputSender.applyRumble.
//
// NOT implemented: locked/relative-in-pointer-lock cursor mode (only plain
// relative and absolute are used), and exact diagonal D-pad hat values — both
// precision/cosmetic gaps, not correctness gaps.
