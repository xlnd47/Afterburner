// MARK: - Boosteroid Realtime (WebSocket) Client
//
// CONFIRMED 2026-07-22, but via STATIC analysis, not live traffic capture:
// two separate live-capture attempts (patching `window.WebSocket` from
// page-context JS, both immediately before and well after triggering a real
// queue) caught zero connections, despite the web UI's "Posição na fila"
// (queue position) visibly updating live with no corresponding REST poll.
// The reason turned out to be structural: this connection is opened once,
// app-wide, right after login/token-refresh — by the time any post-
// navigation script injection can run, Boosteroid's own bundle has already
// executed and grabbed its reference to the real `WebSocket` constructor.
//
// NOTE: this client exists purely to show a live numeric queue position —
// it is NOT needed to know when a session becomes active. That's
// BoosteroidClient's `last-session` endpoint, CONFIRMED reliable end-to-end
// (EN -> LI transition) once a genuinely fresh session is enqueued — see its
// Session Lifecycle note. An earlier pass through this investigation
// mistakenly concluded last-session was broken/stale, based on one account
// that had a leftover, never-cleared session confusing repeat lookups; that
// was account-state, not an endpoint problem.
//
// The real mechanism was instead found by fetching Boosteroid's own
// (unminified-enough) Angular bundle chunks and reading the relevant
// service's source directly — CONFIRMED from `chunk-D5WQZFGI.js`:
//
//   buildWebsocketUrl(e) {
//     let t = e.wss ? "wss:" : "ws:", o = new URL(t + e.address);
//     o.port = e.port;
//     o.searchParams.append("uid", e.uid.toString());
//     o.searchParams.append("token", e.token);
//     return o;
//   }
//   // called as: this.connect({ uid: t.id, token: o.access_token,
//   //   wss: !!ue.WSS_PORT, port: ue.WSS_PORT ?? ue.WS_PORT, address: ue.WS_HOST })
//
// with the real config values (from `chunk-BA6XJICU.js`):
//   WS_HOST: "cloud.boosteroid.com/ws", WS_PORT: "443", WSS_PORT: "443"
//
// i.e. the real URL is `wss://cloud.boosteroid.com/ws?uid=<id>&token=<jwt>`,
// where `uid` is the numeric id from GET /api/v1/user and `token` is the
// RAW access-token JWT (no "Bearer " prefix — that's an HTTP header
// convention, not part of the token itself).
//
// Every message is JSON: `{"type":..., "action":..., "value":...}`.
// CONFIRMED handling from the same bundle: `action === "closed"` (with a
// specific `value` enum member) means the token was rejected and needs
// refreshing; `type === "pong"` is a heartbeat reply to a client-sent ping.
// CONFIRMED 2026-07-24 BY LIVE CAPTURE of this socket (an earlier pass knew
// only the `value: {appId, eta, position}` shape, from the app's NgRx state
// in `chunk-MH64ZJOD.js`, and could not observe the routing): queue pushes
// are
//   {"type":"queues","action":"state","value":{position, appId, eta}}
// arriving about once a second while queued, with `position` and `eta`
// (seconds) counting down — e.g. {appId: 2715, position: 90, eta: 1076}.
//
// IMPORTANT, also confirmed by that capture: these pushes are per-APP and
// cover EVERY queue the account is standing in — including leftovers from
// previously launched games, which keep counting down after you launch
// something else. So a push's appId frequently is NOT the game currently
// being launched; callers must match on appId (see StreamView). Equally,
// some games produce no queue push at all (eFootball was observed sitting
// at last-session "EN" with no `queues/state` message ever referencing it),
// so a missing position is not necessarily a bug.
//
// Anything else is surfaced via `.raw` — not needed for the app to function
// (see NOTE above), but useful for a future pass wanting richer queue state.
