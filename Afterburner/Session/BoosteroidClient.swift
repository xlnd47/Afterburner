    //   2. GET /api/v1/streaming/user/last-session → 200
    //      {"data":{"sessionId":"<uuid>","appId":<int>,"status":"EN"}}
    //      while queued, flipping to `"status":"LI"` (CONFIRMED — "Live",
    //      presumably) once the session is genuinely active. This is where
    //      the sessionId comes from — enqueue's own response never carries
    //      one. NOTE: an EARLIER pass through this investigation saw
    //      last-session apparently "stuck" returning a stale, already
    //      timed-out session's data (appId 836) no matter how many fresh
    //      enqueue calls were made for a different app. That turned out to
    //      be specific to that one leftover session (probably orphaned by
    //      test enqueue/cancel calls made directly via fetch(), bypassing

    //      endpoint is reliable; don't reintroduce the WebSocket-based
    //      redesign that was drafted while this looked like a dead end.
    //   3. Once ready, the UI navigates to
    //      cloud.boosteroid.com/static/streaming/streaming.html?sessionId={uuid}
    //      which calls POST /api/v1/streaming/session/details?sessionId=...
    //      (CONFIRMED POST-only; GET → 405), whose CONFIRMED success body is
    //      {"data":{"gw":"https://sp7.cloud.boosteroid.com:443",
    //      "queryString":"<jwt>"}} — `gw` is exactly SessionInfo.nodeBaseUrl,
    //      confirmed by watching the real client's subsequent getIceServers/
