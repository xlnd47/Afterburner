# Versioning is calendar-based (YYYY.MM.DD), stamped from today's date, so a
# build always carries the same version as the release tag it goes out under
# and nothing has to be bumped by hand. Override it when cutting a second
# release on the same day, or when rebuilding an older tag:
#
#   VERSION=2026.08.10.1 ./scripts/build-ipa.sh
#
# Unsigned is the default on purpose. Sideloadly (and any comparable tool)
# re-signs the app with whatever Apple ID the end user provides, so baking in a
# signature here would only be thrown away — and requiring one would mean every
# contributor needs a paid account just to produce a build.
#
# For --signed, pass your team id via the environment:
#   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=ABCDE12345 ./scripts/build-ipa.sh --signed
# The project deliberately does not hardcode a team (see Local.xcconfig.example).
